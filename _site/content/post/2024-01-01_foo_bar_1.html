<p>If you’ve got files hidden around your system and you don’t know where they are, you can use a quick  command to track them down and sort them with the largest first. Handy when trying to prune your old  files or free up space on your hard disk.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<p>```
sudo du –max-depth=1 /home/ | sort -n -rs</p>
